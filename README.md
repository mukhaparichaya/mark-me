# Face Recognition Based Attendance System 📸🧑‍🏫

This project is a smart **Attendance Management System** that uses **Face Recognition** technology to automate and streamline the process of marking attendance.

Instead of calling out names or signing sheets, the system simply scans faces using a camera and instantly recognizes registered users to mark their attendance — **secure, fast, and contactless**! 🕒✅
